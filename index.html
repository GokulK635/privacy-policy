    <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Replace all square-bracket sections like <code>[PAI Delivery App]</code>, 
        <code>[Gokulakannan]</code>, <code>[gokulk@techative.in]</code> with your real details before publishing.
    </div>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>[PAI Delivery App]</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) 
        collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application 
        (the “App”). By installing or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        The App itself does not require you to create an account. We may collect limited 
        personal information only in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you contact us for support (e.g., your name, email address, and message content).</li>
        <li>When you optionally register or sign in using third‑party providers (e.g., Google Sign‑In), if implemented.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any personal information you voluntarily provide is used only for the purpose for which you provided it.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Non‑Personal / Usage Information</h3>
    <p>
        We may automatically collect non‑personal information while you use the App, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version, language, country).</li>
        <li>App usage data (screens visited, session duration, interaction events).</li>
        <li>Log data and diagnostic information (crash reports, performance data).</li>
        <li>Approximate location (if enabled via permissions or network), used only for feature or analytics purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information cannot be used to directly identify you and is used to improve stability, performance, and usability.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Permissions Used by the App</h3>
    <p>The App may request the following permissions strictly to enable specific features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet access</strong> – to communicate with our backend services, APIs, and third‑party services.</li>
        <li><strong>Network state</strong> – to detect online/offline status and optimize data usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage / Photos / Media / Files</strong> – to read or write files only when needed for features such as exporting, importing, or caching content.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> – to capture images or scan QR codes within the App (if your App has these features).</li>
        <li><strong>Location (Approximate or Precise)</strong> – used only when required by a feature, such as showing location‑based content or services.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notifications</strong> – to send you important updates, alerts, or feature‑related messages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Permissions are used <strong>only</strong> to provide the relevant App functionality and are not used to collect data unrelated to those functions.
        If your App does not use some of the above, you may safely remove those lines before publishing.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain core App functionality.</li>
        <li>Improve App performance, features, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Monitor usage and analyze trends.</li>
        <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes.</li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries and support requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App may use third‑party services that collect information used to identify you or your device in a limited way. These may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – for anonymous usage analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – for crash reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>AdMob</strong> (if ads are shown) – for displaying in‑app advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processors (Google Play Billing)</strong> – for handling in‑app purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These third parties have their own privacy policies governing how they use data. We encourage you to review them before using the App.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ads and In‑App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        If the App displays ads (via AdMob or similar services), these services may use cookies or advertising identifiers 
        to show you more relevant ads. You can reset or limit ad tracking in your device settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the App offers in‑app purchases or subscriptions, payment is processed securely through Google Play. 
        We do not receive or store your full payment information (such as complete credit card numbers).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, 
        alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, 
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, 
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Aggregated, anonymized data may be retained 
        for analytics and reporting.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is <strong>not intended for children under 13 years of age</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal 
        information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal 
        information to us, please contact us so that we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control or revoke permissions at any time via your device settings.</li>
        <li>Disable analytics or personalized ads where supported by your device or Google settings.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to stop all data collection and usage.</li>
        <li>Contact us to request deletion of personally identifiable information you have provided, if any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Our servers or service providers may be located in countries other than your own. By using the App, 
        you consent to the transfer of your information to such countries, which may have different data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated 
        “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
